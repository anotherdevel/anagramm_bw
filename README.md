# Anagram testing
Simple demo of how to compare two given strings for having the same characters. 

## Stack
This project is based on the [vite vanilla-ts template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online).
It's build with HTML, SCSS and TypeScript. Yarn is used as package manager.

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:anotherdevel/anagramm_bw.git directory_name
cd directory_name
yarn install

# For development run
yarn dev

# To build
yarn build
```

## Development
When running `yarn dev` vite is setting up a development server, which is reachable in the browser from the url shown on the cli.

## Build
To build the application, run `yarn build`. When doing so, vite will compile, optimize and minify all assets needed to the `directory/dist` folder.
To reach the application, a webserver needs to deliver the index.html file in this directory.
